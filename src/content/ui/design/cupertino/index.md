The Flutter Cupertino library is a collection
of widgets that implement Apple's iOS design language
for Flutter apps. The widgets have a similar look
and feel to iOS, including rounded corners, gradients,
and minimalistic design.
They also include iOS interactions and animations.

To learn more about Cuperino design and Flutter,
check out:

* The (mostly visual) [Cupertino widget catalog][]
  on doc.flutter.dev
* The [Cupertino library][] page in the API docs

PENDING:
What other resources can we link to?
- There _was_ a Cupertino codelab that got pulled
  from our codelab site because it was out of date.
  However, a version still
  exists on the Chinese codelabs site.
- I looked for an Umbrella bug for the Cupertino
  library, but couldn't find one.
- I searched the projects on the flutter/flutter
  repo for "Cupertino" but found nothing.
